DJIA Predictions using textual analysis:

Algorithms used Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and Ridge regression
In this project, we have aimed to develop a predictive model that can read through the daily news and predict DJIA movement for the next day thus eradicating the hassle of manually reading the news and predicting the market movement.

The objective of our research is: 
(1) predict the movement for the next day by analyzing current news, 
(2) predict the movement for the next by analyzing news from past three days, and 
(3) predict the movement for the next by analyzing news of past 5 days. 
At the end of the research we will have 72 models to compare and find the best fit.
